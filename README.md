# Finding-Best-Stocks-using-ML
We apply a variety of classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and decision trees, to the data and compare the performance of each method. The best parameters are obtained after the hyperparameter tuning of Random forest using the 9 best parameters we predict the stock can be a buy/hold or sell. 
# Streamlit App
We made an app that predict the stocks whether to buy or not using the best parameters/finacial indicators using streamlit.
